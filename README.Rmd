This repo has some data and code that Eric compiled while checking some results
from relationship inference from splitnose rockfish.

To reproduce the analyses you will want to have these packages installed:
`tidyverse`, `stringr`, `downloader`.

The main analysis file is `R-main/01-do-some-pipe-runs.R`  

To do the structure and colony stuff you have to be working on a modern mac.
Those parts of the analysis are just described in the comments in 
`R-main/01-do-some-pipe-runs.R`.
