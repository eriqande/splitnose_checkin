#### SLG PIPE DOWNLOADING ####
#' download the slg_pipe repo and binaries and install it
#' 
#' Just a convenience function that wraps up a few different commands.  If the directory
#' slg_pipe already exists, this function does nothing.
#' @param dir  the directory in which to stick slg_pipe.  Default is .
#' @param commit  The SHA-1 hash for the commit of slg_pipe that you want to
#' get.
#' @param binary_pack  Web address of the binary pack to download.
